                    <h6>Blind Cat Rescue & Sanctuary</h6>
                    <p> Blind Cat Rescue & Sanctuary is a lifetime sanctuary for blind, FIV positive and Leukemia positive
                         cats located in St. Pauls, North Carolina. It was founded by a mother and daughter team to answer the need for a 
                         safe space for blind cats that were deemed not adoptable by regular shelters. Blind cats are regularly killed at shelters because of their condition, 
                         and this is the case for FIV+ and Leukeumia positive cats as well.</p>

                    <p>Upon reviewing the Blind Cat website, our team discovered several major flaws. The biggest one was that the Donate button was difficult to find, which could 
                        surely hinder some potential donations. Our team needed to conduct a total overhaul. </p>

                <h6>boldatwork.</h6>
                <p>I looked through Stromae's entire visual archive in order to better understand his brand and how he wanted others to perceive him. The designers at boldatwork. worked with Stromae to create the final visual system for the album. Stromae had significant influence on the final product, especially the primary display font, which is an "impossible" version of Century Gothic that was custom-made for this project.
                    In fact, Century Gothic was the only typeface that boldatwork. ended up using. I thought, "well, if it ain't broke don't fix it", and did the same.

                    <p>Stromae already had quite the established brand before the release of “racine carrée”. His taste in fashion can be summarized 
                        as the combination of African wax print patterns with English schoolboy silhouettes. His other important visual influence was 
                        the artist M.C. Escher whose work became the basis for my album design.</p>

                <h6>Mosaert</h6>
                <p>Mosaert is an independent creative label based in Brussels. They are mainly active in the fashion, music, and audiovisual sector. It was founded in 2009 by Stromae (real name: Paul Van Haver) and his brother Luc Van Haver. The label oversees everything from production, 
                        artist direction, visuals, and videos. In 2012, they began producing clothes for the public.<br><br>
                        I referred to their brand for inspiration on clothing, patterns, and style. My final colour palette was based on the colours of their logo.</p>

                <h6>M.C. Escher's Influence</h6>
                <p>M.C. Escher is an obvious reference in Stromae's aesthetic which features impossible 
                    geometry and mathematic tessalations. After staring at the square root symobl (√) for a while, 
                    and then staring at "Relativity" by Escher, I connected the dots and thought, "what 
                    if I could make a square root symbol out of stairs?". That initial connection 
                    would guide me through the rest of my process. I was also inspired by Escher's depiction
                    of a mobius strip and utilized it in my take on a potential tour poster.

                <h6>Album Cover</h6>
                <p>
                    I included white figures walking together with one lone pink misfit to emphasize one of the album’s themes which was the loss of one's identity. 
                    I felt that many of the songs tapped into absurdist beliefs which I represented with a nonsensical maze-like environment that serves as a metaphor for life.
                    <br><br>
                    The front and back of the album cover tell a short sequential story. The downtrodden misfit takes a leap of faith and escapes the monotonous maze, though whether it is to their benefit or detriment is left to the viewer's imagination.

                <h6>Tour Poster</h6>
                <p>
                    The title of the tour postere translates to "The European Tour" and the large text at the bottom reads "The 8th Anniversary". As this is for a European concert, the dates are written in a 
                    date/month/year format instead of a month/date/year format. Continuing with the geometric motifs from the album cover, I utilized a möbius strip as the main visual graphic. I also reused the orb from the back of the 
                    album cover to tie the two pieces together.
                </p>

                <h6>Spotify Graphics</h6>
                <p>
                    I created another version of the album cover to be displayed on Spotify. The physical album cover is reliant on its three-dimensional aspect and without the ability to display the back or the slip jacket 
                    a lot of the storytelling aspects would be lost so I omitted the storytelling entirely and let the viewer focus on the maze-like environment.
                    For the banner, I used a close-up of the image I made using the impossible version of the Century Gothic typeface that Stromae commissioned from the original album designers.

                <p>
                    Stromae loves fashion. His brand, Mosaert, releases a limited number of clothing items every year in a capsule collection. 
                    It was only appropriate that the tour merch should include some shirts, specifically polo shirts to fit in with the English schoolboy aesthetic that Stromae frequently wore at the time of the album's release.

                <h6>The Return of Stromae</h6>
                <p>
                    When I began this project, Stromae hadn't released any new music since 2013 except for one single called "Défiler". He had taken an indefinite hiatus from the music industry and many of his fans, including me, thought 
                    he would never release another song again. On October 15, 2021, one week before the end of this project, Stromae released a new single called "Santé". 
                    I'm not saying I had anything to do with it, but, who knows? 😳 I'm just glad I get to hear his voice again.
